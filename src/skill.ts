# quota-axi

${DESCRIPTION}

You do not need quota-axi installed globally - invoke it with \`npx -y quota-axi\`.

quota-axi is data only: it never routes, recommends, proxies, intercepts, logs in, imports
browser cookies, or mutates provider state. It reads local Claude and Codex auth files and
calls first-party provider usage endpoints; it never launches the Claude CLI, so it cannot
spend the quota it measures.

## When to use

Use quota-axi whenever you need local quota headroom before deciding whether it is safe to
keep working on a provider, when the user asks about usage, rate limits, or remaining quota,
or when comparing Claude and Codex headroom side by side.

## Workflow

1. Run \`npx -y quota-axi\` for compact TOON output covering both providers' quota windows.
2. Scope to one provider with \`--provider claude\` or \`--provider codex\`.
3. Pass \`--json\` for the normalized machine-readable model instead of TOON.
4. Pass \`--full\` to include account identity and per-source attempt details.
5. Run \`npx -y quota-axi auth\` to check local auth-source availability without printing
   secret values.
6. On macOS, Claude Keychain value reads are skipped by default until the user grants access once.
   If quota output reports \`reason: keychain_access_required\`, tell your user to run
   \`quota-axi --allow-keychain-prompt\` once and approve Keychain access ("Always Allow").
   After that successful grant, plain \`quota-axi\` calls reuse the existing Keychain access
   marker to refresh live Claude quota without requiring the flag.

## Usage

\`\`\`
${TOP_HELP.trimEnd()}
\`\`\`

## Tips

- Output is TOON-encoded and token-efficient by default; pass \`--json\` only when you need
  the normalized schema.
- Exit code 0 means at least one provider returned data (fresh or stale); exit code 1 means
  every provider failed; exit code 2 means a usage error.
- Percentages are not comparable across providers - quota-axi never claims one provider's
  percentage equals another's.
- The cache at \`~/.cache/quota-axi/quotas.json\` only ever holds normalized non-secret
  snapshots; nothing quota-axi prints or caches reveals credential values.
